A default .jar file is included to circumvent the need for compiling the java code. To get this working, simply copy the default compiled .jar file into its partent directory:

A default .jar file is included to circumvent the need for compiling the java code. To make this working, simply copy the default compiled .jar file into its partent directory:                                                                                                                                                                                        cp target/default/companion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  target/ 

To recompile, make sure maven is installed (e.g. run "brew install maven" on mac os). You then execute:

.\mvnw clean package  

This is required to be executed before you can run the docker with the backend or the docker compose that runs both the backend and the frontend together.


## Instructions to run the command line tool
* Compiling

For regular compilation, also ensure maven installed (e.g. run "brew install maven" on mac os). You then execute:

mvn install

* Running

To see how to use the tool, simply run without options:

java -jar target/companion-queries-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

For example:

java -jar target/companion-queries-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar check test.list


Important: only works if executed in this folder.
