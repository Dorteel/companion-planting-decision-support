\section{Use Cases}

\subsection{Finding (Anti-)Companions}

If we have a specific plant, and want to look for (anti-)companinons, these can be
directly queried using a subclass query, already in Prot\'eg\'e, using the class expression
\verb|companion some PLANT| respectively \verb|anti_companion some PLANT|, where PLANT is
the identified of the corresponding plant. For each plant, we can furthermore ask for detailed
explanations using the functionality of Prot\'eg\'e (see \Cref{fig:})

All relevant axioms are in the OWL EL profile, more
specifically in the subset that is supported by the ELK reasoner. As a consequence
